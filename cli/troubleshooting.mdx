This page covers common issues you might encounter when using the Wavedash CLI.

## Authentication issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Browser doesn't open during login">
    **Problem:** Running `wvdsh auth login` doesn't open a browser.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Copy the URL from the terminal and paste it into your browser manually
    2. Use manual token entry: `wvdsh auth login --token YOUR_API_KEY`
    3. Check if your default browser is configured correctly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Login fails or times out">
    **Problem:** The login process fails or doesn't complete.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure you're connected to the internet
    2. Check that wavedash.com is accessible
    3. Try a different browser
    4. Check your firewall settings for blocked outbound connections
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API key not working">
    **Problem:** Commands fail with authentication errors despite being logged in.

    **Solutions:**
    ```bash
    wvdsh auth logout
    wvdsh auth login
    ```
    If the issue persists, generate a new API key in the Developer Dashboard.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development server issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Certificate not trusted">
    **Problem:** Browser shows security warnings when accessing localhost.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Accept the certificate in your browser (proceed anyway)
    2. Regenerate the certificate:
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.config/gg/wavedash/cli/dev-server/
    wvdsh dev
    ```
    3. Manually trust the certificate in your system settings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    **Problem:** Error about port 7777 being in use.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Find and stop the process using the port:
    ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    lsof -i :7777
    kill <PID>

    # Windows
    netstat -ano | findstr :7777
    taskkill /PID <PID> /F
    ```
    2. Wait a moment and try again (the previous server may be shutting down)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Game files not found">
    **Problem:** Server starts but game doesn't load.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify `upload_dir` in `wavedash.toml` is correct
    2. Check that your build files exist in the specified directory
    3. Ensure you've exported/built your game before running `wvdsh dev`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CORS errors in browser console">
    **Problem:** Browser console shows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing errors.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure you're accessing via `https://localhost:7777`, not `http://`
    2. The sandbox URL should be from `*.sandbox.wavedash.com`
    3. Clear your browser cache and cookies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Build upload issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload fails midway">
    **Problem:** Build upload starts but fails before completing.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check your internet connection stability
    2. Try again - temporary network issues can cause failures
    3. If you have a large build, ensure you have a stable connection
    4. Check if you're hitting size limits for your plan
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build not appearing in dashboard">
    **Problem:** Upload succeeds but build doesn't show up.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Refresh the dashboard page
    2. Check you're looking at the correct branch
    3. Wait a few moments - processing may take time
    4. Check the CLI output for any warnings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    **Problem:** Error about not having permission to push.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify you're a member of the organization
    2. Check your role has push permissions
    3. Ensure the org_slug and game_slug are correct
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong files uploaded">
    **Problem:** Build contains unexpected files or is missing files.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Double-check your `upload_dir` path
    2. Ensure you've built/exported your game first
    3. The CLI uploads everything in `upload_dir` - check for unwanted files
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuration issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="wavedash.toml not found">
    **Problem:** CLI can't find your configuration file.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure `wavedash.toml` is in the current directory
    2. Use `--config` to specify the path:
    ```bash
    wvdsh dev --config ./path/to/wavedash.toml
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid configuration">
    **Problem:** CLI reports configuration validation errors.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check all required fields are present
    2. Ensure you have exactly ONE engine section
    3. Verify slug formats (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
    4. Check TOML syntax for typos
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Engine version not supported">
    **Problem:** Build or dev fails due to unsupported engine version.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check the supported versions in the Wavedash documentation
    2. Update your engine version string to a supported format
    3. For Godot, use format like "4.5-stable"
    4. For Unity, use format like "6000.0.2f1"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keychain access denied">

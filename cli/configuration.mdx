The `wavedash.toml` file defines your game project settings for the Wavedash CLI.

## File location

Create `wavedash.toml` in your project root. The CLI looks for it in the current directory by default, or you can specify a path with `--config`.

## Basic structure

```toml wavedash.toml
org_slug = "your-organization"
game_slug = "your-game"
branch_slug = "production"
upload_dir = "./build"

# Choose ONE engine section
[godot]
version = "4.5-stable"
```

## Required fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `org_slug` | string | Your organization's URL slug |
| `game_slug` | string | Your game's URL slug |
| `branch_slug` | string | The branch to push builds to |
| `upload_dir` | string | Path to your built game files (relative to config file) |

<Note>
Find your org and game slugs in the Wavedash Developer Dashboard.
</Note>

## Engine configuration

You must include **exactly one** engine section. This tells Wavedash how to load and run your game.

### Godot

```toml
[godot]
version = "4.5-stable"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Godot version (e.g., "4.5-stable", "4.4-stable") |

<Tip>
Export your Godot project as HTML5. The `upload_dir` should contain the exported `.html`, `.pck`, `.wasm`, and `.js` files.
</Tip>

### Unity

```toml
[unity]
version = "6000.0.2f1"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Unity version (e.g., "6000.0.2f1") |

<Tip>
Build your Unity project for WebGL. The `upload_dir` should contain the Build folder with `index.html` and the `Build/` subfolder.
</Tip>

### Custom

```toml
[custom]
version = "1.0.0"
entrypoint = "game.js"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Your game's version number |
| `entrypoint` | string | JavaScript file that initializes your game |

<Tip>
Use the custom engine for HTML5 games, js-dos games, or any web-based game with a JavaScript entry point.
</Tip>

## Complete examples

### Godot project

```toml wavedash.toml
org_slug = "awesome-games"
game_slug = "space-shooter"
branch_slug = "production"
upload_dir = "./exports/web"

[godot]
version = "4.5-stable"
```

### Unity project

```toml wavedash.toml
org_slug = "indie-studio"
game_slug = "puzzle-quest"
branch_slug = "staging"
upload_dir = "./Builds/WebGL"

[unity]
version = "6000.0.2f1"
```

### Custom HTML5 game

```toml wavedash.toml
org_slug = "retro-games"
game_slug = "classic-adventure"
branch_slug = "production"
upload_dir = "./dist"

[custom]
version = "2.1.0"
entrypoint = "src/main.js"
```

## Multiple configurations

For different deployment targets, create separate config files:

```
project/
├── wavedash.toml           # Production config
├── wavedash.staging.toml   # Staging config
└── wavedash.dev.toml       # Development config
```

Use them with the `--config` flag:

```bash
wvdsh build push --config wavedash.staging.toml
```

## Path resolution

The `upload_dir` path is resolved relative to the location of the `wavedash.toml` file, not the current working directory.

**Example:**
```
project/
├── config/
│   └── wavedash.toml    # upload_dir = "../build"
└── build/
    └── index.html
```

## Validation

The CLI validates your configuration before running commands. Common validation errors:

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| Missing required field | A required field is not set |
| Invalid engine section | More than one engine section, or none |
| Upload directory not found | The `upload_dir` path doesn't exist |
| Invalid slug format | Slugs contain invalid characters |

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version control">
    Commit your `wavedash.toml` to version control so team members can push builds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Branch strategy">
    Use different branches for different stages:
    - `production` for live builds
    - `staging` for QA testing
    - `development` for internal builds
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CI/CD integration">
    Use environment variables or separate config files for automated deployments.

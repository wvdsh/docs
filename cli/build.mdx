title: "Build & Push"
description: "Upload your game builds to Wavedash"
---

The `wvdsh build push` command uploads your compiled game to Wavedash.

## Usage

```bash
wvdsh build push
```

This:
1. Reads your `wavedash.toml` configuration
2. Validates your authentication
3. Uploads your game files to Wavedash
4. Creates a new build on the specified branch

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c, --config <PATH>` | Path to wavedash.toml (default: `./wavedash.toml`) |

### Example

Push using a custom config:
```bash
wvdsh build push --config ./deploy/wavedash.toml
```

## Prerequisites

Before pushing a build:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Log in with `wvdsh auth login` if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export your game">
    Export your game for web:
    - **Godot**: Export as HTML5
    - **Unity**: Build for WebGL
    - **Custom**: Bundle your HTML/JS files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure wavedash.toml">
    Create a `wavedash.toml` with your org, game, and branch slugs. See the [Configuration](/cli/configuration) page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication check">
    The CLI verifies you're logged in with a valid API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credential request">
    The CLI requests temporary upload credentials from the Wavedash API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File upload">
    All files from your `upload_dir` are uploaded to our servers with progress tracking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build creation">
    The CLI notifies Wavedash that the upload is complete, and a new build is created on your branch.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## File handling

The CLI uploads:
- All files in your `upload_dir` recursively
- Your `wavedash.toml` configuration (copied to upload dir if needed)
- Custom entrypoint files (for custom engine projects)

<Note>
The directory structure is preserved during upload. Files are uploaded relative to `upload_dir`.
</Note>

## Branches

Builds are pushed to the branch specified in your `wavedash.toml`:

```toml
branch_slug = "production"
```

Common branch strategies:

| Branch | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| `production` | Live builds for players |
| `staging` | Pre-release testing |
| `development` | Internal development builds |

<Tip>
Create different `wavedash.toml` files for each branch, or use environment-specific configs.
</Tip>

## Build size limits

<Info>
Check your plan limits in the Wavedash Dashboard. Build size limits vary by plan.

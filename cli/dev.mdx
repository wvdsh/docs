The `wvdsh dev` command starts a local HTTPS development server that lets you test your game in the Wavedash sandbox environment before publishing.

## Usage

```bash
wvdsh dev
```

This:
1. Reads your `wavedash.toml` configuration
2. Starts an HTTPS server at `https://localhost:7777`
3. Opens your game in the Wavedash sandbox environment
4. Serves files from your `upload_dir`

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c, --config <PATH>` | Path to wavedash.toml (default: `./wavedash.toml`) |
| `--no-open` | Don't open the browser automatically |

### Examples

Use a custom config file:
```bash
wvdsh dev --config ./configs/wavedash.toml
```

Start without opening the browser:
```bash
wvdsh dev --no-open
```

## How it works

The dev server creates a local testing environment that mimics the production Wavedash platform:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Certificate generation">
    On first run, the CLI generates a self-signed SSL certificate and installs it in your system's trust store. This enables HTTPS which is required for many browser APIs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File serving">
    The server serves your game files from the `upload_dir` specified in your config. It automatically handles compression and content types.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sandbox redirect">
    Your browser opens the Wavedash sandbox with your local server as the game origin. This lets you test SDK features with real backend services.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Certificate trust

The first time you run `wvdsh dev`, the CLI generates and installs a self-signed certificate:

| Platform | Certificate location |
|----------|---------------------|
| macOS | System Keychain |
| Windows | Certificate Store |
| Linux | `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` |

<Warning>
You may see a security prompt asking to trust the certificate. Accept it to enable HTTPS.
</Warning>

### Certificate files

Certificates are stored in your config directory:

```
~/.config/gg/wavedash/cli/dev-server/
├── cert.pem
└── key.pem
```

## Supported features

The local dev server supports:

- **CORS headers** for wavedash.com domains
- **Compression** (gzip, brotli) for applicable files
- **Content-Type detection** for common file types
- **Pre-compressed files** (`.gz`, `.br` extensions)

## File serving

The server automatically:

1. Locates your HTML entrypoint (searches for `index.html`, then any `.html` file)
2. Serves files from your `upload_dir`
3. Handles engine-specific files (Godot `.pck`, Unity `.data`, etc.)

## Sandbox URL

When the dev server starts, it builds a sandbox URL with:

- Your game metadata (org, game, branch slugs)
- Local origin (`https://localhost:7777`)
- Engine type and version
- Entrypoint parameters

The URL format is:
```
https://{game_slug}.sandbox.wavedash.com/sandbox/permission-grant?...
```

## Stopping the server

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the dev server. It will:
- Shut down the HTTPS server
- Clean up any temporary files
- Display a summary of served requests

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Certificate not trusted">
    If you see certificate warnings, try removing and regenerating the certificate:
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.config/gg/wavedash/cli/dev-server/
    wvdsh dev
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Port 7777 in use">
    The dev server uses port 7777 by default. If it's in use, check for other running instances or processes using the port.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Files not found">
    Ensure your `upload_dir` in `wavedash.toml` points to the correct directory containing your built game files.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CORS errors">
    The dev server automatically adds CORS headers for wavedash.com domains. If you're testing from a different origin, you may need to adjust your testing approach.

The `wvdsh auth` commands manage your authentication with Wavedash.

## Login

```bash
wvdsh auth login
```

This opens your default browser to complete OAuth authentication. Once you authorize the CLI, your API key is stored locally.

### Manual token entry

If browser-based login isn't available, you can provide an API key directly:

```bash
wvdsh auth login --token YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
You can generate API keys in the Developer Dashboard at [wavedash.com](https://wavedash.com/developers/dashboard).
</Note>

### How it works

1. The CLI starts a local HTTP server on an available port (starting at 7777)
2. Your browser opens the Wavedash authorization page
3. After you authorize, Wavedash redirects back to the local server with your API key
4. The CLI stores the key in your credentials file

## Logout

```bash
wvdsh auth logout
```

This removes your stored API key from the local credentials file.

## Status

```bash
wvdsh auth status
```

Check your current authentication status. If logged in, this displays a masked preview of your API key (first 6 and last 3 characters).

**Example output:**

```
Logged in
API Key: abc123...xyz
```

## Credentials file

Your API key is stored in a JSON file with restricted permissions:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| macOS | `~/.config/gg/wavedash/cli/credentials.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/gg/wavedash/cli/credentials.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\gg\wavedash\cli\credentials.json` |

<Warning>
Never share your credentials file or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

  <Accordion title="Browser doesn't open automatically">
    If the browser doesn't open, copy the URL from the terminal and paste it into your browser manually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    The CLI automatically finds an available port starting at 7777. If you have firewall issues, ensure outbound connections to wavedash.com are allowed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API key not working">
    Try logging out and logging in again:
    ```bash
    wvdsh auth logout
    wvdsh auth login
    ```

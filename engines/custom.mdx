This guide covers integrating Wavedash with custom HTML5 games or any web-based game that doesn't use Godot or Unity.

## Entrypoint file

The entrypoint file is a JavaScript file that initializes your game within the Wavedash environment. It must handle several required tasks.

### Required globals

Your entrypoint has access to these globals provided by Wavedash:

| Global | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `window.WavedashJS` | The Wavedash SDK instance |
| `document.getElementById('wavedash-target')` | The container element where your game should render |

### Required tasks

Your entrypoint **must** do the following:

1. **Render to `wavedash-target`** - Create your game canvas inside the target element
2. **Report loading progress** - Call `WavedashJS.updateLoadProgressZeroToOne(progress)` with values from 0 to 1
3. **Signal load complete** - Call `WavedashJS.loadComplete()` when your game is ready

### Minimal entrypoint example

```javascript
(async function () {
  // Create your game canvas
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  canvas.style.width = '100%';
  canvas.style.height = '100%';
  document.getElementById('wavedash-target').appendChild(canvas);

  // Report loading progress (0 to 1)
  WavedashJS.updateLoadProgressZeroToOne(0.5);

  // Initialize your game...
  await initializeGame(canvas);

  // Signal that loading is complete
  WavedashJS.loadComplete();
})();
```

## Porting native games

If you have a game written in C, C++, or Rust, you can compile it to WebAssembly using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) and integrate it with Wavedash using the entrypoint pattern above.

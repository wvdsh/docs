---

This page explains how authentication works for both developers (CLI access) and players (game access).

## Developer authentication

Developers authenticate using the Wavedash CLI to push builds and manage games.

### Logging in

```bash
wvdsh auth login
```

This opens your browser for OAuth authentication. After authorizing, your API key is stored locally.

### Manual token entry

For CI/CD or headless environments:

```bash
wvdsh auth login --token YOUR_API_KEY
```

Generate API keys in the [Developer Dashboard](https://wavedash.com/developers/dashboard).

### Checking status

```bash
wvdsh auth status
```

Shows your current authentication state and a masked preview of your API key.

### Logging out

```bash
wvdsh auth logout
```

Removes stored credentials from your machine.

### Credentials storage

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| macOS | `~/.config/gg/wavedash/cli/credentials.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/gg/wavedash/cli/credentials.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\gg\wavedash\cli\credentials.json` |

<Warning>
Never share your credentials file or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Player authentication

Players authenticate through Wavedash to access games. The SDK handles this automatically.

### How it works

1. Player logs into Wavedash (wavedash.com)
2. Player launches your game
3. SDK receives a JWT token automatically
4. SDK uses the token for all API calls

### Accessing user info

In your game, access the authenticated player:

```javascript
// Get user ID
const userId = WavedashJS.getUserId();

// Get user info
const user = WavedashJS.getUser();
console.log(`Player: ${user.username}`);
```

### Token lifecycle

- **Issued**: When player starts the game
- **Refreshed**: Automatically by the SDK
- **Expired**: When player ends their session

You don't need to manage tokens directly—the SDK handles all token operations.

## Gameplay tokens

For features like leaderboards and lobbies, the SDK uses **gameplay-specific tokens** that include:

- Game ID
- Player ID
- Permissions for that game

These tokens are:
- Scoped to the specific game
- Short-lived for security
- Automatically refreshed

## API keys

For automated workflows, generate API keys in the Developer Dashboard:

1. Go to [wavedash.com](https://wavedash.com)
2. Open Developer Dashboard
3. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
4. Create a new key

### Key types

| Type | Use case |
|------|----------|
| Personal | Individual developer CLI access |
| CI/CD | Automated build pipelines |
| Service | Server-to-server integrations |

### Using API keys

```bash
# Set via environment variable
export WAVEDASH_API_KEY=your_key_here
wvdsh build push

# Or pass directly
wvdsh auth login --token your_key_here
```

### Key permissions

API keys inherit the permissions of the user who created them:
- Organization membership
- Game access levels
- Branch push permissions

## CI/CD integration

For automated deployments, use API keys in your CI/CD pipeline:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub Actions">
    ```yaml
    - name: Push to Wavedash
      env:
        WAVEDASH_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAVEDASH_API_KEY }}
      run: |
        wvdsh auth login --token $WAVEDASH_API_KEY
        wvdsh build push
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitLab CI">
    ```yaml
    deploy:
      script:
        - wvdsh auth login --token $WAVEDASH_API_KEY
        - wvdsh build push
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Protect API keys">
    - Never commit keys to version control
    - Use environment variables or secrets managers
    - Rotate keys periodically
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use minimal permissions">
    - Create separate keys for different purposes
    - Limit CI/CD keys to specific branches
    - Revoke unused keys
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage">
    - Check API key usage in the dashboard
    - Set up alerts for unusual activity
    - Review access logs regularly

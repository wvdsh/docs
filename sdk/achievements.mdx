The Achievements API lets you track player statistics and award achievements based on their progress. Stats persist across sessions and sync automatically.

<Note>
Achievements are currently created by the Wavedash team. Contact us at [developer@wavedash.com](mailto:developer@wavedash.com) or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/bBaWUjTJWx) to set up achievements for your game. Dashboard creation is coming soon.
</Note>

## Stats

Stats are numeric values that track player progress, like total kills, distance traveled, or games played.

### Setting a stat

```javascript
WavedashJS.setStat("total_kills", 150);
WavedashJS.setStat("distance_traveled", 5280.5);
WavedashJS.setStat("games_played", 42);
```

<Note>
Stat updates are debounced (batched) to reduce network calls. Changes are synced automatically after a short delay.
</Note>

### Getting a stat

```javascript
const kills = WavedashJS.getStat("total_kills");
console.log(`Total kills: ${kills}`);
```

### Incrementing a stat

For cumulative stats, get the current value and add to it:

```javascript
const current = WavedashJS.getStat("coins_collected") || 0;
WavedashJS.setStat("coins_collected", current + 10);
```

## Achievements

Achievements are unlockable awards that recognize player accomplishments.

### Unlocking an achievement

```javascript
const response = await WavedashJS.setAchievement("first_win");

if (response.success) {
  console.log("Achievement unlocked!");
}
```

### Checking achievement status

```javascript
const isUnlocked = WavedashJS.getAchievement("first_win");

if (isUnlocked) {
  console.log("Player has already earned this achievement");
}
```

### Achievements with progress

Some achievements may be tied to stats. When a stat reaches a threshold, the achievement unlocks automatically (configured in the Wavedash dashboard).

```javascript
// Update the stat - achievement unlocks automatically if threshold is met
WavedashJS.setStat("enemies_defeated", 100);
// If there's an achievement for 100 enemies, it will unlock
```

## Stat-linked achievements

In the Wavedash dashboard, you can configure achievements that automatically unlock when a stat reaches a certain value:

| Achievement | Stat | Threshold |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| "First Blood" | kills | 1 |
| "Centurion" | kills | 100 |
| "Marathon" | distance_traveled | 26219 |

When you update a stat, any linked achievements are checked and unlocked automatically.

## Local caching

Stats and achievements are cached locally for fast access:

- `getStat()` and `getAchievement()` return cached values instantly
- `setStat()` and `setAchievement()` update the cache immediately
- Changes sync to the server automatically (debounced to reduce API calls)

## Session handling

The SDK automatically saves pending stat updates when the player leaves:

- On page unload (`beforeunload` event)
- On page hide (`pagehide` event)
- When leaving a game session

You don't need to manually flush stats.

## Disabling stats

For demo games or testing, you can disable stats tracking:

```javascript
// Typically configured in the game setup, not at runtime
// This prevents demo play from polluting real stats
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive stat names">
    Use clear, snake_case names like `total_kills`, `games_won`, or `highest_score`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update stats incrementally">
    For cumulative stats, get the current value and add to it rather than tracking locally.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't spam stat updates">
    The SDK debounces updates, but avoid calling `setStat` every frame. Batch updates where possible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure achievements in the dashboard">
    Define achievement names, descriptions, and icons in the Wavedash dashboard rather than hardcoding.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Kill tracking

```javascript
// Player gets a kill
function onEnemyKilled() {
  // Increment kill stat
  const kills = (WavedashJS.getStat("total_kills") || 0) + 1;
  WavedashJS.setStat("total_kills", kills);

  // Session kills (for display)
  sessionKills++;

  // Check for manual achievements
  if (kills === 1) {
    WavedashJS.setAchievement("first_blood");
  }
}
```

## Example: Score tracking

```javascript
// Game over - save high score
function onGameOver(score) {
  const highScore = WavedashJS.getStat("high_score") || 0;

  if (score > highScore) {
    WavedashJS.setStat("high_score", score);
    console.log("New high score!");
  }

  // Track games played
  const gamesPlayed = (WavedashJS.getStat("games_played") || 0) + 1;
  WavedashJS.setStat("games_played", gamesPlayed);
}
```

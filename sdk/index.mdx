The Wavedash JavaScript SDK enables you to integrate online services into your web-based games. It provides APIs for leaderboards, multiplayer lobbies, peer-to-peer networking, achievements, cloud storage, and more.

## How it works

The SDK is automatically loaded when your game runs on Wavedash. It's available as a global `WavedashJS` object that provides access to all online services.

```javascript
// The SDK is automatically available in your game
const user = WavedashJS.getUser();
console.log(`Playing as: ${user.username}`);

// Get a leaderboard and submit a score
const leaderboard = await WavedashJS.getLeaderboard("high-scores");
if (leaderboard.success) {
  await WavedashJS.uploadLeaderboardScore({
    leaderboardId: leaderboard.data.id,
    score: 1000,
    keepBest: true
  });
}
```

## Response format

All SDK methods return a `WavedashResponse` object with a consistent structure:

```typescript
interface WavedashResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;     // Whether the operation succeeded
  data: T | null;       // The result data (null on failure)
  args: Record<string, any>;  // Original arguments passed
  message?: string;     // Error message if success is false
}
```

**Example response handling:**

```javascript
const response = await WavedashJS.getLeaderboard("high-scores");

if (response.success) {
  const leaderboard = response.data;
  console.log(`Leaderboard: ${leaderboard.name}`);
  console.log(`Total entries: ${leaderboard.totalEntries}`);
} else {
  console.error(`Error: ${response.message}`);
}
```

## Engine integration

The SDK works with all supported game engines:

| Engine | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| Godot | Native GDScript bindings via Wavedash Godot SDK |
| Unity | JavaScript interop via Unity WebGL |
| Custom | Direct JavaScript API access |

See the [Engine Guides](/engines/godot) for engine-specific setup instructions.

## Signals (Events)

The SDK emits signals to notify your game of real-time events like new lobby messages or P2P connections. See the [Signals Reference](/sdk/signals) for the complete list.

```gdscript
# Godot example
func _ready():
    Wavedash.lobby_message.connect(_on_lobby_message)

func _on_lobby_message(message: Dictionary):
    print("New message: ", message.content)
```

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your game">
    Configure your project with `wavedash.toml` and test locally with `wvdsh dev`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    The SDK initializes automatically. Use `WavedashJS.isReady()` to check status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call SDK methods">
    Access leaderboards, lobbies, and other services through the `WavedashJS` global.
  </Step>
</Steps>

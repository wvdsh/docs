The Wavedash SDK initializes automatically when your game loads on Wavedash. This page explains the initialization process and configuration options.

## Automatic initialization

When your game runs on Wavedash (either locally with `wvdsh dev` or in production), the SDK is automatically:

1. Loaded into the page
2. Configured with your game's credentials
3. Connected to the Wavedash backend
4. Made available as `window.WavedashJS`

You don't need to manually initialize the SDK in most cases.

## Checking ready state

Before calling SDK methods, verify the SDK is ready:

```javascript
// Check if SDK is ready
if (WavedashJS.isReady()) {
  // SDK is ready to use
  const response = await WavedashJS.getLeaderboard("high-scores");
}
```

## Configuration options

The SDK accepts configuration through the `init()` method. While this is typically called automatically, you can customize behavior:

```typescript
interface WavedashConfig {
  gameId: string;              // Your game's ID (set automatically)
  debug?: boolean;             // Enable debug logging
  remoteStorageOrigin?: string; // Custom storage origin
  p2p?: Partial<P2PConfig>;    // P2P networking options
  disableAchievementsAndStats?: boolean; // Disable stats tracking
  deferEvents?: boolean;       // Defer event signals until ready
}
```

### Debug mode

Enable verbose logging to help debug SDK issues:

```javascript
// Debug mode is typically set via the Wavedash dashboard
// or automatically enabled in development
```

### P2P configuration

Customize peer-to-peer networking:

```typescript
interface P2PConfig {
  maxPeers: number;              // Maximum concurrent peer connections
  enableReliableChannel: boolean;  // Enable reliable (TCP-like) channel
  enableUnreliableChannel: boolean; // Enable unreliable (UDP-like) channel
}
```

## Event deferral

By default, the SDK starts sending signals to your game immediately. If you need to defer events until your game is ready:

```javascript
// Signal you're ready to receive events
WavedashJS.readyForEvents();
```

This is useful when your game needs time to set up event listeners before receiving signals.

## Current user

Access the authenticated user's information:

```javascript
// Get the current user's ID
const userId = WavedashJS.getUserId();

// Get user info (username, etc.)
const user = WavedashJS.getUser();
console.log(`Playing as: ${user.username}`);
```

## Backend connection

The SDK automatically manages the connection to the Wavedash backend and emits signals for connection state changes:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `BACKEND_CONNECTED` | Successfully connected to backend |
| `BACKEND_DISCONNECTED` | Disconnected from backend |
| `BACKEND_RECONNECTING` | Attempting to reconnect |

See [Signals Reference](/sdk/signals) for handling these events.

## Engine-specific initialization

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Godot">
    The Wavedash Godot SDK wraps the JavaScript SDK. Initialize in your autoload:

    ```gdscript
    # Wavedash.gd (Autoload)
    extends Node

    func _ready():
        # SDK is automatically initialized
        # Connect to signals you need
        Wavedash.backend_connected.connect(_on_connected)

    func _on_connected():
        print("Connected to Wavedash!")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unity">
    Access the SDK through JavaScript interop:

    ```csharp
    using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

    public class WavedashSDK : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [DllImport("__Internal")]
        private static extern bool WavedashIsReady();

        void Start()
        {
            if (WavedashIsReady())
            {
                Debug.Log("Wavedash SDK is ready!");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom">
    Access the SDK directly through JavaScript:

    ```javascript
    // Wait for SDK to be ready
    function waitForWavedash() {
      if (window.WavedashJS && WavedashJS.isReady()) {
        initGame();
      } else {
        setTimeout(waitForWavedash, 100);
      }
    }

    waitForWavedash();
    ```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WavedashJS is undefined">
    Ensure you're running your game through Wavedash (either `wvdsh dev` or on wavedash.com). The SDK is not available when running standalone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SDK not ready">
    The SDK may take a moment to initialize. Use `WavedashJS.isReady()` or listen for the `BACKEND_CONNECTED` signal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    The SDK handles authentication automatically. If you see auth errors, ensure your game is properly configured in the Wavedash dashboard.

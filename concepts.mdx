This page explains the fundamental concepts you'll encounter when building games on Wavedash.

## Organizations

An **organization** is the top-level entity that owns games. Organizations represent studios, teams, or individual developers.

```
Organization: "awesome-games-studio"
├── Game: "space-shooter"
├── Game: "puzzle-quest"
└── Game: "racing-adventure"
```

### Organization slugs

Each organization has a unique **slug** (URL-friendly identifier):

- Must be lowercase
- Can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Used in URLs and API calls
- Example: `awesome-games-studio`

Organizations are created in the Wavedash Developer Dashboard.

## Games

A **game** is a project within an organization. Each game has its own:

- Branches and builds
- Leaderboards
- Achievements
- Cloud storage
- Configuration

### Game slugs

Games also have unique slugs within their organization:

- Must be lowercase
- Can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Example: `space-shooter`

The full path to a game is: `organization-slug/game-slug`

## Branches

**Branches** organize different versions or stages of your game, similar to Git branches.

```
Game: "space-shooter"
├── Branch: "production"    # Live version for players
├── Branch: "staging"       # Pre-release testing
└── Branch: "development"   # Internal development
```

### Common branch strategies

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `production` | Live builds that players access |
| `staging` | QA testing before release |
| `development` | Internal development builds |
| `beta` | Beta testing with selected players |

Each branch is independent—builds on one branch don't affect others.

## Builds

A **build** is a specific version of your game uploaded to a branch. Each time you run `wvdsh build push`, a new build is created.

```
Branch: "production"
├── Build: v1.0.0 (current)
├── Build: v0.9.5
├── Build: v0.9.4
└── Build: v0.9.3
```

Builds are:
- **Immutable**: Once uploaded, builds don't change
- **Versioned**: Each build has a unique identifier
- **Switchable**: You can roll back to previous builds

## Game Clouds

A **game cloud** is the backend data layer for a game. It stores:

- Leaderboard data
- Player stats and achievements
- User-generated content
- Remote storage files

Each game has one game cloud that persists across branches and builds.

## Relationships

Here's how all the concepts relate:

```
Wavedash
└── Organization
    └── Game
        ├── Game Cloud (data layer)
        │   ├── Leaderboards
        │   ├── Achievements
        │   └── Remote Storage
        └── Branches
            └── Builds
```

## Configuration file

The `wavedash.toml` file ties these concepts together:

```toml
org_slug = "awesome-games-studio"    # Organization
game_slug = "space-shooter"          # Game
branch_slug = "production"           # Branch
upload_dir = "./build"               # Local build directory

[godot]
version = "4.5-stable"               # Engine config
```

When you run `wvdsh build push`:
1. The CLI reads `wavedash.toml`
2. Uploads files from `upload_dir`
3. Creates a new build on the specified branch

## IDs vs slugs

Wavedash uses both **slugs** (human-readable) and **IDs** (system-generated):

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Slug | Human-readable string | `space-shooter` |
| ID | System-generated string | `j57abc123xyz...` |

**Slugs** are used:
- In configuration files
- In URLs
- When creating resources

**IDs** are used:
- In SDK method calls
- In API responses
- For referencing specific records

```javascript
// Get leaderboard by name (slug)
const response = await WavedashJS.getLeaderboard("high-scores");

// Use the returned ID for subsequent calls
const leaderboardId = response.data.id;
await WavedashJS.uploadLeaderboardScore({
  leaderboardId: leaderboardId, // Use the ID
  score: 1000
});
```

## Player data

Player data is scoped to the **game cloud**, not individual branches or builds:

- Leaderboard scores persist across builds
- Achievements carry over when you update
- Cloud saves work across versions
- Stats accumulate over time

This means players don't lose progress when you release updates.

## Access control

Wavedash manages access at multiple levels:

| Level | Controls |
|-------|----------|
| Organization | Who can manage games |
| Game | Who can push builds |
| Branch | Which builds are live |
| Player | Game ownership/access |

Players can access games through:
- **Purchase**: Buying the game
- **Gift code**: Redeeming a code
- **Grant**: Developer-assigned access

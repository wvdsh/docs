This guide walks you through setting up the Wavedash CLI, configuring your project, and publishing your first build.

<Info>
**Early Access** — Wavedash is currently onboarding developers on an invite-only basis. We're working toward opening the platform to everyone soon. Interested in joining? Reach out to [partnerships@wavedash.com](mailto:partnerships@wavedash.com) to learn more.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Wavedash developer account at [wavedash.com](https://wavedash.com)
- A game exported for web (Godot, Unity WebGL, or custom HTML5)
- A terminal application

## Install the CLI

Follow the [installation instructions](/cli#installation) for your platform, then verify:

```bash
wvdsh --version
```

## Authenticate

Log in to your Wavedash account:

```bash
wvdsh auth login
```

This opens your browser to complete authentication. Once logged in, your credentials are stored locally.

<Check>
Run `wvdsh auth status` to confirm you're authenticated.
</Check>

## Create your game on Wavedash

1. Go to [wavedash.com](https://wavedash.com) and sign in
2. Navigate to the Developer Dashboard
3. Create a new organization (or use an existing one)
4. Create a new game and note the **org slug** and **game slug**

## Configure your project

Create a `wavedash.toml` file in your project root. See [Configuration](/cli/configuration) for your engine:

- [Godot configuration](/cli/configuration#godot)
- [Unity configuration](/cli/configuration#unity)
- [Custom engine configuration](/cli/configuration#custom-engine)

## Test locally

Start the local development server to test your game:

```bash
wvdsh dev
```

This:
1. Starts an HTTPS server at `https://localhost:7777`
2. Opens your game in the Wavedash sandbox environment
3. Allows you to test SDK features before publishing

<Warning>
The first time you run `wvdsh dev`, you may need to trust the self-signed certificate. Follow the prompts in your terminal.
</Warning>

## Publish your build

When you're ready to publish:

```bash
wvdsh build push
```

This uploads your game to Wavedash and creates a new build on the specified branch.

Your game is now live! Visit your game page on wavedash.com to play.

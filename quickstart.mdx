This guide walks you through setting up the Wavedash CLI, configuring your project, and publishing your first build.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Wavedash account at [wavedash.com](https://wavedash.com)
- A game exported for web (Godot, Unity WebGL, or custom HTML5)
- A terminal (Homebrew for macOS, shell for Linux, or PowerShell for Windows)

## Install the CLI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    brew install wvdsh/tap/wvdsh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/wvdsh/cli/releases/latest/download/wvdsh-installer.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    irm https://github.com/wvdsh/cli/releases/latest/download/wvdsh-installer.ps1 | iex
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation:

```bash
wvdsh --version
```

## Authenticate

Log in to your Wavedash account:

```bash
wvdsh auth login
```

This opens your browser to complete authentication. Once logged in, your credentials are stored locally.

<Check>
Run `wvdsh auth status` to confirm you're authenticated.
</Check>

## Create your game on Wavedash

1. Go to [wavedash.com](https://wavedash.com) and sign in
2. Navigate to the Developer Dashboard
3. Create a new organization (or use an existing one)
4. Create a new game and note the **org slug** and **game slug**

## Configure your project

Create a `wavedash.toml` file in your project root:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Godot">
    ```toml wavedash.toml
    org_slug = "your-org"
    game_slug = "your-game"
    branch_slug = "production"
    upload_dir = "./build/web"

    [godot]
    version = "4.5-stable"
    ```

    <Note>
    Set `upload_dir` to your Godot web export folder.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unity">
    ```toml wavedash.toml
    org_slug = "your-org"
    game_slug = "your-game"
    branch_slug = "production"
    upload_dir = "./Build/WebGL"

    [unity]
    version = "6000.0.2f1"
    ```

    <Note>
    Set `upload_dir` to your Unity WebGL build folder.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom">
    ```toml wavedash.toml
    org_slug = "your-org"
    game_slug = "your-game"
    branch_slug = "production"
    upload_dir = "./dist"

    [custom]
    version = "1.0.0"
    entrypoint = "game.js"
    ```

    <Note>
    The `entrypoint` is the JavaScript file that initializes your game. See [Entrypoint file requirements](/engines/custom#entrypoint-file) for what your entrypoint must do.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Test locally

Start the local development server to test your game:

```bash
wvdsh dev
```

This:
1. Starts an HTTPS server at `https://localhost:7777`
2. Opens your game in the Wavedash sandbox environment
3. Allows you to test SDK features before publishing

<Warning>
The first time you run `wvdsh dev`, you may need to trust the self-signed certificate. Follow the prompts in your terminal.
</Warning>

## Publish your build

When you're ready to publish:

```bash
wvdsh build push
```

This uploads your game to Wavedash and creates a new build on the specified branch.

Your game is now live! Visit your game page on wavedash.com to play.

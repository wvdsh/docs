## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Install the Wavedash CLI to authenticate and manage your game builds.

    ```bash
    brew install wvdsh/tap/wvdsh
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your project">
    Create a `wavedash.toml` file to define your game and build settings.

    ```toml
    org_slug = "your-org"
    game_slug = "your-game"
    branch_slug = "production"
    upload_dir = "./build"

    [godot]
    version = "4.5-stable"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate the SDK">
    Add the Wavedash SDK to your game to access online services.

    ```javascript
    // Get current player
    const user = WavedashJS.getUser();
    console.log(`Welcome, ${user.username}!`);

    // Submit a score
    await WavedashJS.uploadLeaderboardScore({
      leaderboardId: leaderboard.id,
      score: 1000,
      keepBest: true
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your game">
    Push your build to Wavedash and share it with players.
